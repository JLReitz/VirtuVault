vvault

A password and encrypted file vault to be stored on a home server. When called from a machine running the client, it will access the database located on the server and 
return queried passwords or files over an encrypted network connection.

	vvault -[Query-type] -[Option]... [Topic]

Vvault will default to the password recovery of a single entry if no query-type or options are given.
	
When there is more than one result from any given query, the client will display all given results and ask the user for a specification on which one in particular to yield 
information on or modify.
	
Query Type:

	- P -- Password
		Query for a password to an account or service.
	- F -- File
		Query for a file being stored in the vault.
	
Option:

	- a -- Add entry
		Adds a new entry to the vault. If a file is added, it will be automatically added to the encrypted directory, but the user can specify this by 
		adding -Dec or -Enc to the command line.
	- d -- Delete entry
		Deletes an entry from the vault.
	- k -- Keyword
		Returns a list of entries matching the keyword given. Implicitly uses the same lisitng function as -l, but can also be used in conjunction with -l for the same
		result.
	- l -- List
		Lists all returned results from the query. This is done automatically if there is more than one result, but will also query the user for one specific
		result to continue the operation on if this is the case. Adding this option manually will only list results without querying for a specific entry.
		
		This function is used implicitly within -k and -e as well without the need for it to be called externally on the command line.
	- Settings -- Change settings for the process
		This will not accept a topic or any other options when this is entered into the command line, and will ignore any that are included. This option allows you
		to change settings for the service, such as the user's master password and directory locations for the files stored by vvault.
		
		Extra settings-specific options can be added to the command line to move directly to a specific setting:
		
			vvault -Settings -[Settings option] "[Entry]"
		
		Including the settings option will move the process directly to the setting that the user wants to change. Adding an entry in quotations will then immediately
		change the setting to the entry and terminate the program. This form of settings change is available, but not recommended unless the user knows exactly how
		to change each setting before going this route.
		
		- auth -- Change when user authentication with the master password is required.
			- 1 -- Authentication is required whenever vvault is used
			- 2 -- Authentication is only required when encrypted information is queried
			- 3 -- Authentication is only required when passwords are queried
			- 4 -- Authentication is only required when encyrpted files are queried
		- ddir -- Change the decrypted directory location
		- edir -- Change the encrypted directory location
		- mp -- Change the master password
	- v -- View
		Will display the password of all returned password entries, or display the description of all returned file entries. Can be used in conjunction 
		with any process that utilizes the -l listing function.
	
	Password-Specific:
	
	- c -- Change
		Changes the password for the requested entry. The new password can be placed in quotations after the topic in the command line, or be entered when queried for
		it after the single entry is specified.
	- cpy -- Copy to clipboard
		Copies the returned result from the process, if there is one, to the system clipboard.
		
	File-Specific:
	
	- Dec -- Decrypt
		Deecrypt the requested file and move it into the decrypted directory. This will make it available to any device that will SSH into the server filesystem or 
		access the directory through any other means.
	- e -- Extention type
		Returns a list of all files of a specified extension type. Implicitly uses the same lisitng function as -l, but can also be used in conjunction with -l
		for the same result.
	- Enc -- Encyrpt
		Encrypt the requested file and move it into the encrypted directory. This will make it available only to the vvault client-server connection.
