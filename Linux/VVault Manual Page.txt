Call:

	vvault -[Query-type] -[Option]... [Topic]
	
Query Type:

	- P -- Password
		Query for a password to an account or service. That account or service name will be entered into [Query]
	- F -- File
		Query for a file being stored in the vault. That file name will be entered into [Query]
	
Option:

	- k -- Keyword
		Returns a list of entries matching the keyword given. Implicitly uses the same lisitng function as -l, but can also be used in conjunction with -l for the same
		result.
	- l -- List
		Lists all returned results from the query. This is done automatically if there is more than one result, but will also query the user for one specific
		result to continue the operation on if this is the case. Adding this option manually will only list results without asking for a specifier.
	
	Password-Specific:
	
	- c -- Copy to clipboard
		Copies the returned result from the command, if there is one, to the system clipboard
	- v -- View
		View the contained passwords next to the names of each result. Can be used in conjunction with -l to view a list of results and their associated passwords.
		
	File-Specific:
	
	- e -- Extention Type
		Returns a list of all files of a specified extension type. Implicitly uses the same lisitng function as -l, but can also be used in conjunction with -l
		for the same result.
